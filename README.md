This project is following along with the LinkedIn Learning course React.js: Building an Interface: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-js-building-an-interface-8551484/ by Ray Villalobos: https://raybo.org/

Generally I watch the video and follow along, but also make my own modifications to appeal to my tastes and ensure that I understand the concepts.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Uses Tailwind CSS.

The instruction include Tailwind CSS for easy formatting: https://tailwindcss.com/. It appears to be similar to bootstrap.
